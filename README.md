# Introduction     
In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a decentralized Kickstarter dApp having features namely create a project, fund a project, withdraw fund, get refund if funding isn't successful etc. We will build the smart contract in Solidity and the frontend of our application with the help of ReactJS.  
Avalanche is a low cost, high-speed blockchain network on which we can deploy smart contracts written in solidity. Due to its low gas fees and a high number of transactions per second, Avalanche is a good platform for deploying dApps on it.
